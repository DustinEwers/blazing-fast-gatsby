When doing a technology demo, it's important that everyone in the room can see your screen. This usually means bumping up your view to 150%-200% depending on the screen, room, and relative blindness of the people in your audience. I demo a lot of web technologies, so I find myself showing the Chrome developer tools. Fun fact, when you zoom web pages in Chrome, that setting doesn't apply to the developer tools. Fortunately, this is easy to fix.
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
To zoom in Chrome developer tools:
open the developer tools window,
hold down ctrl,
press + or - to zoom in and out.
