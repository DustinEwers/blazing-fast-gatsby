                <p>
                    My name is Dustin Ewers. I'm a developer who buildsÂ software to help people get more done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started programming in 2001 (in C++). Since then, I've chosen to focus my efforts on building user friendly web applications with C#, Typescript, and ASP.NET. I also dabble in lots of other technologies because I get bored easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to focus on the human side of software development. I believe that the primary purpose of technology is to improve people's lives. At the end of the day, software is less about code and more about communicating clearly with other people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not slinging code, I like to hang out with my family, read books (non-fiction and sci-fi), make things, and spend time in the woods.
                </p>
                <p>
